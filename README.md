# mihama

[osv.dev](https://osv.dev/) API clone for on-premise usage.

## Why?

osv.dev is an OSS project. ([google/osv.dev](https://github.com/google/osv.dev))

But it is highly coupled with GCP. So it is difficult to deploy osv.dev on premise. (ref. [Deploy osv.dev on-premise #546](https://github.com/google/osv.dev/issues/546))
